# AI Interview Questions Repository

A curated collection of high-quality interview questions and answers for AI-related roles. This repository helps candidates understand how interviews differ across roles—not just memorize answers.

## 🎯 Purpose

Different AI roles require different thinking patterns:

| Role | Primary Focus | Key Thinking Pattern |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **AI Engineer** | Building & deploying AI systems | "How do I make this work reliably in production?" |
| **ML Engineer** | Training & optimizing models | "How do I improve model performance and efficiency?" |
| **AI Researcher** | Advancing the field | "Why does this work, and what's fundamentally new?" |
| **Data Scientist** | Extracting insights & business value | "What story does the data tell, and how does it drive decisions?" |
| **AI Architect** | System design & scalability | "How do all these pieces fit together at scale?" |

- **Trade-off awareness** - Do you understand costs and benefits?
- **Practical judgment** - Can you make decisions with incomplete information?
- **Communication** - Can you explain complex ideas clearly?
