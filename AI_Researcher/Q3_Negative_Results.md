# AI Researcher Interview Question

## Topic: Negative Results & Publication

---

### Question

> You spent months on a research direction that didn't pan out—the method doesn't work as hoped. How do you decide what to do with this work, and how do you think about "failed" research?

---

### Answer

"Failed" research is often more valuable than it appears—both to the field and to your own development. The question is how to extract and communicate that value.

---

#### Reframing "Failure"

First, I'd distinguish between types of negative results:

**Type 1: The hypothesis was wrong**
- You tested a well-motivated idea and it doesn't work
- This is valuable information—it prevents others from trying the same thing

**Type 2: The method needs refinement**
- Core idea might be sound, but implementation or assumptions need work
- There might be a path forward with modifications

**Type 3: The problem is harder than expected**
- You've characterized why something is difficult
- This shapes the field's understanding of the challenge

Each type has different implications for what to do next.

#### My Decision Framework

**Question 1: Why didn't it work?**

Before deciding what to do, I need to understand the failure mode:

- Did I test the hypothesis correctly? (Implementation bugs, evaluation issues?)
- Are the negative results robust? (Consistent across settings, seeds, variations?)
- Did I miss a key assumption that would make it work?
- Is there a fundamental reason it can't work?

Rigorous analysis of failure often reveals insights publication-worthy on their own.

**Question 2: What did I learn?**

Even when the main result is negative, there are often positive byproducts:

- Better understanding of the problem structure
- New analysis tools or experimental methodology
- Interesting observations that weren't the main focus
- Clearer understanding of what a solution would need

**Question 3: Would this save others time and effort?**

The key question for publication: Is there enough value for the community?

- Is this a path others might try? (Negative results are most valuable for popular ideas)
- Are the insights generalizable beyond this specific approach?
- Do the experiments reveal something new about the problem?

#### Publication Options

**Option 1: Negative results paper**

Some venues explicitly welcome negative results (workshops, journals like TMLR). A good negative results paper:

- Clearly states the hypothesis that didn't work
- Provides rigorous evidence for the negative result
- Analyzes *why* it didn't work
- Offers insights that redirect future research

This is undervalued in our field but genuinely important.

**Option 2: Position/analysis paper**

Reframe the work as an analysis of the problem space:

- "We investigated X approaches to problem Y and found that Z"
- Focus on what the negative results reveal about the problem
- Provide recommendations for future work

**Option 3: Part of a larger paper**

Include negative results as ablations or analysis in a paper that has positive results:

- "We also tried X, which didn't work because Y"
- This contextualizes your positive results and strengthens the paper

**Option 4: Technical report / blog post**

If not publication-worthy but still useful:

- Write up the key findings informally
- Share with the research community
- Others can cite it to save duplicating effort

**Option 5: Pivot the research**

Use the insights to redirect:

- What would need to be true for this to work?
- Can you address those requirements?
- Is there a related problem where your approach *does* work?

#### Personal Development Perspective

Beyond publication, "failed" projects develop crucial skills:

**Intellectual resilience**: Research involves lots of negative results. Learning to extract value from them is essential.

**Taste development**: Understanding why things don't work sharpens intuition for what might work.

**Rigor**: Debugging failures requires careful analysis that improves your methodology.

**Honesty**: Being clear-eyed about negative results builds credibility and avoids self-deception.

#### The Conversation with Advisors/Managers

"The main hypothesis didn't work—here's what I found and why. But the work isn't wasted:

1. **For the field**: These negative results would prevent others from trying the same path. I think a [workshop paper / technical report / section in future paper] is appropriate.

2. **For our research**: I learned that [key insight]. This suggests we should try [modified direction] instead.

3. **Timeline**: I can wrap up the negative results write-up in [X time] while starting the new direction.

What's your read on the value of publishing the negative results versus moving on quickly?"
